Part 1 Report

Implementation:
    I largely followed the example done in recitation where you modify the
    return value of the function in order to skip over some set of
    instructions.  This assignment had a different call stack structure
    though, in that all of the registers were pushed onto the stack as well.
    This required me to skip past all 16 of them (-m32) in order to get to
    the return address.  The final offset, including my integer variable
    used as a reference point on the stack was 72 bytes (assuming sizeof
    int is 4).

Results:
    Each call to the signal handler consitently took under 1 microsecond,
    so that is pretty fast. This is expected to be faster than fork or pipe
    because there is not a lot of memory copying that needs to occur.

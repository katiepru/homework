Assignment 8a

1.
  a.) ADoc would better match the query than Bdoc.
      This is because dot products of ADoc and Q and Bdoc and Q will be the
      same, but BDoc will be twice as long as Adoc. Algebraically, this can be
      shown as follows, where d = dot product of ADoc or BDoc and Q.
      ADoc: d/len(Q)*len(ADOC) = cos(theta1)
      BDoc: d/len(Q)*2*len(ADoc) = cos(theta2)
      Because cos(theta2) is smaller than cos(theta1), ADoc will be a
      better match, assuming that Q contains at least 1 term in ADoc.
      Otherwise they both will not match as the dot products will be 0.

  b.) Let TF1 be the term frequency vector of the terms in Q in ADoc.
      Let TF2 be the term frequency vector of the terms in Q in BDoc.
      TF2 can be obtained from TF1 by multiplying every entry in TF1 by 2.
      This means that the dot product of TF2 and Q will be greater than
      or equal to that of TF1 and Q.
      These dot products are only equal when they equal 0, otherwise the
      former will always be larger.
      Specifically, the former must be twice as large as the latter because
      every entry in the summation is mulitplied by 2.
      Let d = dot product of TF1 and Q
      cosine(theta1) = d/len(Q)*len(ADoc)
      cosine(theta(2) = 2d/Len(Q)*2*len(ADoc)
      Therefore, theta1=theta2, so they are equally weighted.

  c.) Let TF1 and TF2 be the same as in the previous problem.
      IDF = [log(2/2), log(2/2)...]
      IDF = [0, 0, 0, ...]
      Therefore, neither document will be shown to match because
      wk is going to be a vector of all 0s, as derrived from IDF[j]*TF[j].


2. The relevant documents are d3, d7, d8, d11, and d12.
   This was found by using m for each point (k/5, k/m).

3. 
    a.) Expections of values
        - I expect B and C to be the most valuable because they have the
          most links to them
        - A and D should be about the same value because they have the
          same link structure
    b.) M = [1/2   1/2   0     0
             0     0     1/2   0
             0     1     0     0
             0     0     1/2   1/2]

2. From looking at a graph of the probabilities of the sequence being each
length, it seems as though  geometric distibution is followed once l=4,
but is irregular before that. Because of this, I chose to do special cases
for l=1 through l=3. The HMM is shown in the file prob2_hmm.pdf. All states
shown other than END have tied emissions.

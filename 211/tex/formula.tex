\maketitle

Note that I used 64 bit assembly for this project.

\section*{Algorithm}

The implementation of this program was pretty straightforward. I implemented
factorial and nCr in assembly, checking for overflow in both functions.  I then 
used these functions in formula.c to compute the coefficient of each term of the
expanded binomial. I print each term as I go, checking for overflow.

\section*{Big O Analysis}

This program is $O(1)$ space complexity because nothing get stored.

This program is $O(n^{2})$ time complexity because factorial is $n$ and you have
to do factorial on $n$ terms, making the overall time complexity $O(n^{2})$.

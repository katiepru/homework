\section*{Algorithm}

This project works only for integers up to 32 bits. It works by converting all 
of the inputs into long ints through their appropriate conversions. It then does
the arithmetic on those long ints, and procedes to convert them into their 
specified output format through the appropriate conversion. 

\section*{Big O Analysis}

Time complexity: O(n)

The time complexity of this algorith is O(n). The algorithm can be split into 
three main parts: converting to a long int, doing the operation, and converting 
to the output format. The first part is O(n) as we have to loop over the string
to do the conversion. The second part is O(1), as it is a simple arithmetic 
operation. Lastly, the last part is at worst O(n) because the int must be 
converted to a string.

Space complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is also O(n) because the original numbers are stored in 
long ints. The conversions themselves are O(1) space complexity.

\section*{Difficulties}

I had originally tried to do arbitrary length for this assignment, but could not
get it to work in time. I was getting close though, so it was dissapointing.

\section*{\bf Astronomerâ€™s Toolkit: Light, Telescopes, and Relativity}
\end{center}

Astronomers have a very strong and varied arsenal of tools at their disposal to
study the cosmos.  Perhaps one of their strongest and most useful tools for this
is the telescope, which allows astronomers to study the light that celestial
bodies emits.  One may be able to imagine that telescopes are very useful tools
for a variety of reasons, but they are not the only tool astronomers can utilize
to help them understand celestial phenomena.  There is another set of tools
astronomers use that does not include physical instruments, rather, previous
theories.  Perhaps one of the most influential theories ever created in the
realm of physics is Einstein's theory of special and general relativity.  By
using both physical tools such as telescopes, along with intellectual tools such
as Einstein's theories, astronomers can better understand the universe.

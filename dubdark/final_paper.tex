\maketitle

Not long ago, supermassive black holes were a completely separate field of study
from that of galaxies.  However, more recent discoveries have shown that these
two types of astronomical objects are very closely related and have measurable
effects on each other.  There are numerous of these effects, and some of these
have been able to explain several of the pitfalls of our previous N-body
simulations, such as having fewer large galaxies than expected as well as
galaxies remaining hotter, and therefore less star formation occurring in older
galaxies than expected.  Therefore, one can see why it would be important to
understand the scaling relations and resulting co-evolution of supermassive
black holes and their host galaxies.

\subsection{Black Hole Basics}
Black holes are extremely massive and dense objects that form a singularity in
spacetime
because they are so massive.  They are so massive that they have what is called
an event horizon, or a position where the escape velocity of any particle
becomes greater than $c$.  This means that even light cannot escape the black
hole's gravity, which is why they cannot be directly observed.  The event
horizon exists because general relativity states that spacetime will become
infinitely curved near a singularity, making it impossible to escape from
without moving faster than the $c$.

In 1916, an astronomer named Karl Schwarzschild described the gravitation field
around a spherical mass such as a black hole.  This is known as the
Schwarzschild metric, and is a solution to Einstein's field equations that
assumes the mass has no charge or angular momentum.  This metric is dependent on
the Schwarzschild radius, which is the distance from the spherical mass to its
event horizon.  For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the earth is only a few
millimeters, whereas the Schwarzschild radius is
approximately $3M$ kilometers, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole in solar
masses.  This relationship was discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916.

Black holes are believed to be able to exist in three different size classes:
miniature, stellar mass, and supermassive.  Stellar mass black holes are the
most common and are formed from the implosion of a dying star, which occurs when
the star is too massive to even be able to form a neutron star.  There is a
great deal of observational evidence for these stellar mass black holes, and
they are most commonly detected in binary systems with other stars.  Miniature
black holes have not been observed, but are theoretically possible to be as
small as particles.  Supermassive black holes are much larger than stellar mass
black holes, on average $10^6 -10^9$ solar masses in size.

\subsection{Supermassive Black Hole Properties and Formation}
Supermassive black holes retain the basic properties of stellar mass black holes
but are scaled up to enormous masses.  This means that they continue to be a
singularity that cause infinite curvature in spacetime because of their huge
densities.  Scientists know that these black holes primarily grow from accreting
matter (this process is described in detail below), and by merging with other
black holes.  However, scientists do not know what causes these objects to form
in the first place.  A few theories for their formation have been proposed.  For
example, it may be possible that large "seed" black holes were formed when early
stars collapsed, as they were hundreds of solar mases in size.  These large
black holes could have then merged to form the supermassive black holes we see
today.  Another proposed solution to this problem is that they formed from the
core collapse of large stars clusters, but again this would only leave black
holes a few hundreds of solar masses in size at most.  A proposed solution that
predicts the formation of larger black holes initially is the direct collapse of
huge gas clouds in early protoglaxies, which would result in black holes between
$10^4 - 10^5$ solar masses in size.  This seems to be the most likely as of now
because we can see supermassive black holes as far back in time as redshift 7,
which would not give these objects a lot of time to form.

Astronomers classify supermassive black holes into two major groups: active and
dormant.  The dormant supermassive black holes can only be detected through
their gravitational effects and are not accreting substantial amounts of matter.
Active supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are accreting large amounts
of matter and as a result are often referred to as active galactic nuclei (AGN).
The details of the accretion process are described in the next section, but some
subtle differences in the observed accretion gives scientists ways to classify
AGN into several subclasses, the main ones being quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and
radio galaxies.  Astronomers can begin to categorize AGN based on their
luminosity in the UV, optical, and infrared spectra.  Quasars fall into the
category where their luminosities in this range are greater than or equal to
that of their host galaxies ($L_{nuc} \ge L_{gal}$).  An AGN is said to be
strong if $L_{nuc} \le L_{gal}$, and it is said to be weak if $L_{nuc} \ll
L_{gal}$.  Seyfert galaxies tend to be strong, while radio galaxies tend to be
weak, although they are more variable than the other types in this regard.  The
other main way to classify an AGN is whether it is radio loud or radio quiet.
Quasars can be radio loud or radio quiet, radio galaxies are always radio loud,
and Seyfert galaxies are always radio quiet.  More information on how these
different AGN can be detected is decribed later.


\subsection{Supermassive Black Hole Accretion}
(CITE science.pdf)
Supermassive black holes grow by accreting large amounts of matter in
galactic systems.  Because of this, an accretion disk forms around the black
hole, and this disk can vary in size.  The formation of this disk is similar
to how any disk-shaped structure forms in the universe, such as the disks in
spiral galaxies or the disk of planets orbiting our sun.  This occurs
because the gas almost always has some angular momentum that prevents it
from directly reaching the gravitational source, in this case the
supermassive black hole.  As a result, the gas settles into a disk-shaped
structures therefore forming the accretion disk.  This disk's orientation is
defined by the overall angular momentum of the gas.  Given such angular
momentum, it appears that friction must be responsible for some of the gas
losing enough angular momentum to actually fall into the black hole, and it
is most likely magnetic forces in the ionized plasma that provides this
friction.

This same magnetic stress that causes changes in angular momentum also
converts some of the gravitational potential energy of the gas into heat.
The process by which this happens is not well understood, but the details of
this process are not needed to determine its effects on the accretion disk,
as the properties of the accretion disk are largely dependent on whether or
not this produced heat is radiated away.  The radiative efficiency of an
accretion disk is modelled by the following equation:
$\epsilon = \frac{L}{Mc^2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the radiated efficiency
(out of 1), $L$ is the produced luminosity, $M$ is the mass-accretion rate,
and $c$ is the speed of light.  This implies that $Mc^2$ is the rate at
which the mass-energy is accreted.  The Eddington limit also applies to the
accretion rate as it sets the upper bound for the luminosity achieved by a
black hole when its radiation pressure is in equlibrium with gravity.

Accretion disks can be divided into two
distinct categories based on their corresponding $\epsilon$.  If the
previously mentioned heat produced is radiated away before faster than it
takes for the gas to flow back into the hole, the result is a much more
efficient accretion disk, with $0.06 \le \epsilon \le 0.4$.  This results in
a thin disk with a thickness of 0.1 - 3\% of its radius.  The disk is thin
because the gas cools rapidly causing it to settle into a thin disk.  These
thin disks are the most efficient known source of power in the universe,
being over 50 times more efficient than nuclear fusion in stars.  When the
conditions for creating a thin disk are not met, meaning that it takes more
time for the heat to be radiated away than for the gas to flow back into the
hole, then there is a substantial drop in efficiency down to $\epsilon \ll
1$.  This produces a thick, hotter disk that is more than 20\% as thick as
its radius.  These thick disks tend to be seen when the accretion rate $M
\ll M_{edd}$.  This is because only a small fraction of the gas can reach
the hole at any one time, resulting in a much dimmer lack hole.  Thick disks
are also preferred when $M \gg M_{edd}$ because the large amounts of gas
prevent heat from being radiated away.  It is only when $M \approx M_{edd}$
that the thin disks are preferred.

The dynamics of the accretion disk seem to play a large role in the dynamics of
another feature of some accreting supermassive black holes: the relativistic
radio jets.  These jets are not present in all supermassive black holes, but
some produces huge radio jets perpendicular to the accretion disk.  These jets
seem to be the most pronounced when the accretion disk is thick, although the
explanation for that phenomenon has not been discovered.  Regardless, these
outflows are much more energetic when the black hole rotating.  One explanation
for the formation of these jets relies on the properties of the ergosphere,
which is an area of spacetime just outside the event horizon where matter cannot
be a rest and must rotate along with the black hole.  The plasma in this area
gets twisted and propagates out, causing a large outflow.

\subsection{Detecting Supermassive Black Holes}
Because supermassive black holes can be active or quiescent, there are several
different ways to detect them based on the state they are in.  Quiescent
supermassive black holes can only be detected by their gravity's influence on
nearby stars and other objects, while active galactic nuclei are generally
detected by their spectral emission lines and other visible properties.

    \subsubsection{Quiescent Supermassive Black Holes}
    If a supermassive black hole is truly dormant, then it can only be detected
    by its gravitational effects on surrounding visible matter.  Because of
    this dilemma, the process of detecting dormant supermassive black holes can
    be compared to that of stellar mass black holes.  Recall that stellar mass
    black holes are most often detected when in binary systems because of their
    effects on the other star in the system.  A similar concept applies to
    supermassive black holes, only instead of being in a binary system, their
    system consists of all of the central stars in a galaxy.  Obviously this
    complicates the process, but there are still some very distinct effects that
    can be observed, all of which are heavily dependent on the black hole's
    sphere of influence.  This describes the area in which the black hole's
    gravity completely overwhelms that of all of the other stars in the system.
    This is typically a relatively small area, only a few arcseconds in size,
    but is still orders of magnitude larger then the event horizon, meaning that
    objects can be observed in a large portion of it.

    The sphere of influence is so important because the supermassive black
    hole's gravity changes the movement of the central stars in a galaxies in
    several ways.  First, it increases the velocity of stars as the approach the
    black hole.  In a galaxy without a black hole center, the speed of the
    central stars tends to level out at about 100 km/s.  This is not the case in
    galaxies with a dormant nucleus, as these speeds would continue to increase
    to larger fractions of $c$.

    Another way that a supermassive black hole's gravity affects central stars
    is by distorting their orbits.  These central stars would normally have a
    random distribution of orbit shapes.  However, which a black hole is
    present, it causes the stars to have more cigar-shaped orbits, especially
    inside the sphere of influence.  This may seem like a subtle distinction,
    but leads to a very important phenomenon: more stars will be near the center
    of the galaxy at any one time, causing the center to appear much more
    luminous.  This group of stars nearer to the center is called the cusp, and
    has been used to successfully detect quiescent supermassive black holes.

    \subsubsection{Active Galactic Nuclei}
    Active galactic nuclei can be easier to detect because they are sources of
    strong radiation, meaning that there are other more direct ways to detect
    them besides their gravitational influence on other objects.  However,
    scientists must be able to distinguish the different types of AGN from each
    other as well as from stellar sources of radiation.  While these
    distinctions are different for each type of AGN, studying an object's
    emission spectra is how these distinctions are made.  Normal stars tend to
    have spectra resembling that of black body radiation, with their peaks being
    in or near the visible range.  Most AGN tend to have much flatter spectra,
    and are especially loud in the x-ray.  They also tend to have at least some
    lines indicating higher levels of ionized gas.  These differences are
    typically how AGN are differentiated from stellar radiation sources.

    Once it is clear that a source of radiation is an AGN, there are several
    characteristic features of each of the major types that allow astronomers to
    classify them.  There seem to be two clear ways that AGN can differ from
    each other.  Quasars, for example, can be radio quiet or radio loud
    depending on the type, but tend to have extremely high optical luminosities
    that often outshone the entire host galaxy ($M_B < -23$).  They also tend to
    have broad and narrow lines of high ionization, although rarely the broad
    lines are not present.  Seyfert galaxies, on the other hand, have more
    moderate luminosity ($M_B > -23$) and are always radio quiet.  Most have
    broad emission lines, and all have narrow lines of high ionization.  Radio
    galaxies are the most radio loud, but do not have clear patterns in the
    optical spectrum.

\subsection{Galaxy Properties and Formation}
Astronomers have discovered many different galaxies throughout times, and these
galaxies can be classified in several different ways based on their different
properties.  When considering nearby galaxies $z < 1$, the Hubble
classification system works well for classifying the many different galaxies in
the Local Group and beyond (CITE hubble classifications).  Hubble's
classification system, which has been revised several times since its initial
incarnation, categorizes galaxies into three main type: spiral, elliptical, and
irregular.  These categories have several subcategories within them describing
the specific morphology of each type, but galaxies that fall into any of these
three categories have many similar characteristics.

    \subsubsection{Spiral Galaxies}
    Spiral galaxies tend to be the go-to example for describing galaxies in general
    as the Milky Way is this type of galaxy.  Spiral galaxies have several main
    morphological components, one of which is the stellar halo (CITE Lecture 10/29).
    This is a spherical region surrounding the galaxy that is on average
    approximately 100 kpcs in size.  This is much larger than the other, more
    luminous visible components.  However, the stars that care found here are very
    sparse and tend to be old, metal-poor stars.  This is also the most common place
    for globular clusters to form.

    Another component of spiral galaxies is the central bulge, which is the very
    luminous central portion of the galaxy which forms a noticeable bulge in the
    center of the disk.  This section contains mostly old, metal-rich stars that
    follow more random orbits due to their proximity to the center.  The central
    bulge on average contains about $\frac{1}{4}$ of the mass of the entire
    galaxy, although the size of the central bulge can vary greatly between
    galaxies.  It also sometimes contains a bar of stars that is more flat.
    This bar can be very pronounced in some galaxies and seemingly nonexistent
    in others, and is one of the ways Hubble determines subcategories within the
    spiral class.

    This central bulge forms the center of the two largest structures in spiral
    galaxies: the thin and thick disks.  These disks make up most of the mass of
    the galaxy, and contain different types of stars in each.  The thin disk,
    which is much larger, contains younger, more metal-rich stars and the thick
    disk contains older, more metal-poor stars.  The stars in these disks have
    higher angular momentums and therefore do not follow random orbits like the
    ones in the central bulge.  Finally, on the edges of the disks, spiral arms
    can be observed, which contain young, metal-rich stars as well as gas and
    dust.

    As a whole, spiral galaxies tend to look very flat because of the thin and
    thick disks.  Furthermore, they tend to have a relatively high amount of new
    star formation going on because of the size and environment of the thin
    disk.  As a result, spiral galaxies tend to look bluer in color, with a more
    red center as less star formation is occurring there.

    \subsubsection{Elliptical Galaxies}
    Elliptical galaxies are much simpler in morphology than spiral galaxies are.
    They are elliptical in shape, and can be categorized by their ellipticity.
    These galaxies in some ways resemble the central bulge of spiral galaxies in
    that there is very little star formation occurring, leaving these type of
    galaxies populated with older, metal-rich stars.  The stars do not have much
    angular momentum, so also take on random orbits.  Elliptical galaxies tend
    to be more luminous towards their centers, and the luminosity drops farther
    away from the center in a smooth way.  These galaxies tend to appear redder
    in color because of their higher density of older stars and lack of new star
    formation.

    \subsubsection{Irregular Galaxies}
    Irregular galaxies are those galaxies which do not fit into either of these
    classifications.  These galaxies vary greatly from one another, and it is
    therefore difficult to make any generalizations about them.

    Note that these classifications of galaxies do not hold up as well at higher
    redshifts, but it is believed that some of the galaxies we see farther away
    are precursors to these types of galaxies.

    \subsubsection*{}
    \vspace{-5mm}
    In order to fully understand how supermassive black holes affect a host
    galaxy throughout its lifetime, it is important to understand the major
    events that happen throughout a galaxy's lifetime.  The first major
    milestone in a galaxy's life is its formation.  This process is believed to
    be very different for spiral and elliptical galaxies.  For spiral galaxies,
    it is believed that their formation of their basic structure is caused by
    the monolithic collapse of primordial cold dust clouds.  This collapse would
    create an environment where star formation would flourish, and the intrinsic
    angular momentum of the gas would be transferred to new stars.

    On the other
    hand, it is believed that elliptical galaxies form from the merging of two
    spiral galaxies that are similar in size.  This type of merging would
    annihilate the disks, giving the resulting galaxy an elliptical shape.  If
    one galaxy was much bigger than the other, then the larger galaxy would be
    able to acquire the smaller one and still keep its general spiral
    morphology, although some of its features could change such as the size of
    the central bulge.

    These two events, formation and merging, make up the two major events in a
    galaxy's lifetime that dramatically change its morphology.  Supermassive
    black holes are believed to play significant roles in these processes, which
    will be further described below.


\subsection{Scaling Relations}
Supermassive black holes, being incredibly dense objects at the center of some
galaxies, should have some effects on the general morphology of the galaxy. It
has been shown that the size of the central bulge in galaxies is correlated
extremely closely with the mass of the galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This
relation is known as the $M \sigma$ relation, where $M$ is the mass of the
central dark object and $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the central
bulge, which is indicative of the mass of the central bulge.  This relationship
has shown that $M \propto \sigma^{4.8}$, and this
relationship has been plotted in Figure 1.  The important takeaway from this
relationship is that the size of the central bulge is proportional to the mass
of the galaxy's supermassive black hole.  Furthermore, the plot shows that there
is very little scatter in the collected data, meaning that this is a very tight
relationship that holds well in most cases.  Noting that the bulge being
referenced refers to the central bulge in spiral galaxies, but the entire
ellipse in elliptical galaxies, it is evident why this relationship is so
important.  The size of elliptical galaxies is often vastly larger than that of
the central bulge in spiral galaxies, meaning that the supermassive black holes
in elliptical galaxies should be much larger than those in spirals.  This is a
logical conclusion from the theory that elliptical galaxies form from the
merging of two or more spirals, as the supermassive black holes at the center of
the spirals would merge into one much larger hole in an elliptical galaxy.

\subsection{Active Galactic Nucleus Feedback}
Since an AGN released large amounts of radiation, this radiation can have
significant impacts on the host galaxy.  This phenomenon when radiation from an
AGN affects the host galaxy is called AGN feedback.  Because of a phenomenon
called
hydrostatic equilibrium, the radiation pressure from the AGN cannot overpower
its gravity or else it would blow itself apart. This is the basis for the
Eddington limit, as described above.  Because it is possible for AGN to exceed
this limit if the accretion based on the size and characteristics of the
accretion disk, it is possible that these AGN could have removed a substantial
amount of gas from early prototgalaxies, even even with a black hole $10_7$
solar masses in size from the AGN feedback.  There are several different methods
that the AGN facilitate feedback, each of which can have different effects on
the host galaxy.  In reality, most AGN would likely utilize more than one of
these methods below.

    \subsubsection{Thermally Driven Winds}
    One simple way that AGN feedback could occur is by the produced radiation
    heating the surrounding gas.  If the gas is heated enough, it will have
    enough energy to escape the black hole's gravitational field.  When this gas
    escapes, it creates an observable wind that is thermally driven.  These
    winds tend to be low in velocity, and this is most likely because this
    method of feedback would be most effective for the gas farthest away from
    the black hole as it would have the lowest escape velocity.  The gas that is
    closest to the black hole would need to be heated to much higher
    temperatures before it could escape entirely.  Even so, heating the gas
    below the escape velocity could have substantial impacts on the accretion
    disk even though the gas would not be able to escape.  This would
    effectively cause the accretion disk to "puff up", allowing it to cool more
    effectively and achieve a balance.

    \subsubsection{Magnetically Driven Winds}
    Magnetically driven winds are likely important sources of outflow, but
    the exact mechanism behind them is not well understood.  From what we do
    know, this process requires a magnetic field that can penetrate the
    accretion disk, and that close to the center of the disk the magnetic field
    is bound to move with the gas in the disk.  As the black hole pulls in new
    material, the magnetic lines therefore get kinked.  As a result of this, the
    orbit of the accretion disk becomes unstable at an angle greater than 30
    degrees, resulting in material being blown away along the now-outward
    magnetic field lines.  Therefore, this magnetic field could become a driver
    for outflows given these initial conditions were met.

    \subsubsection{Radiation Pressure}
    Another way by which an AGN create outflows is through the radiation
    pressure of photons on
    the surrounding material.  However, if the surrounding material is fully
    ionized, the AGN's luminosity would have to be much higher than the
    Eddington limit, which we know is not the case in most AGN.  This means that
    the gas cannot be fully ionized to create substantial outflows.  If there is
    a fair amount of unionized dust around the AGN and we look at a larger area
    around it, the effective Eddington limit often increases by a factor of
    1000.  This would cause the unionized dust to be pushed out.  Furthermore,
    this dust would tend to be charged in this type of environment, so it could
    couple with ionized gas therefore driving out a lot of ionized gas as well.
    Through this process, it is shown how radiation pressure can cause
    significant outflows that would affect the host galaxy.

    \subsubsection{Kinetic Feedback}
    All of the previously mentioned method of AGN feedback have been based on
    radiation, but there is kinetic feedback as well.  There are two main causes
    of this kinetic feedback: the relativistic jets and the radio lobes along
    with x-ray cavities.  First, the relativistic jets are very large,
    especially in radio galaxies.  They often extend into the inner few parsecs
    of the galaxy and are generated by the AGN.  While their inner workings are
    still an open topic of research, they seem to have had different effects on
    the host galaxies at different times in cosmic history.  For example, at
    large reshifts ($z \ge 2$) cold gas was more abundant and these jets would
    have triggered shocks that could thereby stimulate star formation.  However,
    in the more recent universe ($z \le 1$) more of the cold gas has already
    been depleted, so these jets only prevent cooling flows from entering the
    system, therefore inhibiting star formation.


\subsection {Galaxy Merging}
Supermassive black holes add another layer of complexity to galaxy merging, but
this extra complexity is useful in discovering why our previous computational
models differed from observational evidence.

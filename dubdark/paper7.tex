%Star formation
Scientists believe that most stars are born through the compression of gas
clouds.  Essentially, large clouds of gas in a galaxy can become cooler as they
lose energy, which causes them to compact.  This raises their density, and
eventually a gas cloud can become so dense that it collapses on itself.  When
this occurs, every section of the cloud pulls every other section closer
together.  This rapidly raises the density, which in turn causes the temperature
to rise.  Eventually, the temperature will rise to about 10 million degrees,
which is the minimum temperature for nuclear fusion to occur.  This nuclear
fusion is what causes the star to radiate light as it gives off an extreme
amount of energy.

%Size
Because of this process by which stars form, stars can only have masses within a
specific range.  Specifically, the minimum mass is about one tenth of a solar
mass, while the maximum mass is about 100 solar masses.  The minimum mass can be
explained easily by the process outlined above.  Essentially, if the mass is any
less then the cloud cannot reach a high enough temperature for nuclear fusion to
occur, so it remains dark.  The maximum mass, however, is caused by a different
phenomenon entirely.  If a star's mass is too large, it will become luminous
enough that the radiation pushes any external gas away from it, causing it to
lose mass
